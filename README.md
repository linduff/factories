# factories
This project uses Django to create a website. 

### Files of interest:

/tree/forms.py              - defines the Add, Edit, and Delete Factory forms

/tree/models.py             - defines the database objects

/tree/views.py              - functions and data that interact with html data

/tree/templates/index.html  - HTML and javascript for the page

Note: I wanted to put the javascript into a separate file, but for some reason, it wouldn't work correctly. I decided to just put it in the html where it does work.
